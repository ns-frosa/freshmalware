This tool started as a simple page to download dynamically generated files to showcase Patient-0 policies, but then expanded now and also has files that will trigger UEBA policies and multiple unknown malware samples (which are all benign, so completelly harmless).

If you have more ideas of things that should be added here, reach out to the SA team. 

Happy demos
